    Abstract base class for correlated methods to perform orbital selection.

    The general idea is to select orbitals based on criteria including single-site entropies,
    which are computed from an approximate correlated method, for example DMRG. Implementations
    for specific quantum chemical methods should be derived from this base class. A user can
    perform automatic active space selection by following the steps below:

    # Initialize the object. ASFMethod is a subclass of ASFBase, implementing a specific quantum
    # chemical method. An initial orbital subspace to perform the calculation may be specified.
    sf = ASFMethod(...)

    # The correlated calculation (e.g. DMRG) is performed, storing information for the subsequent
    # orbital selection in this object.
    sf.calculate(...)

    # Finally, an active space is selected as a subset of the initially provided orbital space.
    # The method returns the number of selected active electrons and a list of active MOs.

        Setting the initial parameters for the calculation.

        A molecule object and the MO coefficient matrix must always be provided. Aside from that,
        the initializer is intended to be invoked one of the following ways:

        1) __init__(self, mol, mo_coeff)

            The correlated calculation will be performed using all orbitals. Active orbitals can
            be selected from the entire MO space.

        2) __init__(self, mol, mo_coeff, nel, norb)

            An initial active space of nel electrons in norb orbitals is specified by the user.
            The correlated calculation will be performed in this initial active space. Therefore,
            the final active space will be selected from the orbitals in the initial active space.

            The columns in mo_coeff should follow the convention of PySCF for CAS calculations.
            Practically, this implies:
            - The leftmost columns contain the inactive ("core") orbitals that are always doubly
              occupied.
            - The norb columns in the middle contain the initial subspace that the final active
              space will be selected from.
            - The rightmost columns contain the remaining orbitals that are always empty.

        3) __init__(self, mol, mo_coeff, nel=nel, mo_list=mo_list)

            As in option 2), but the user provides a list of orbitals for the initial orbital
            space. mo_list is specified analogously to pyscf.mcscf.sort_mo(..., base=0), so that
            counting starts from zero, not from one! The columns of mo_coeff should be ordered
            along the conventions of PySCF for CAS calculations:
            - mo_list specifies the orbitals to be included in the initial orbital space, which
              the final active space will be selected from.
            - The leftmost columns that are not in mo_list contain inactive ("core") orbitals that
              are always doubly occupied.
            - The remaining columns contain orbitals which are always empty.

        Args:
            mol:                Molecule object
            mo_coeff:           Spin-restricted molecular orbital coefficients

                                convention of pyscf.mcscf.sort_mo(..., base=0): counting starts
                                from zero, not from one.
