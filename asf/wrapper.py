    Entropy-based active space suggestion with DMRG from a set of MP2 natural orbitals.

    The function executes the following steps:
        1)  Calculate MP2 natural orbitals using the SCF object provided in the input.
        2)  Select an initial set of MP2 natural orbitals based on their eigenvalues.
        3)  Perform a DMRG-CASCI calculation using the previously determined orbital subset.
        4)  Select the final active space based on the entropies from the DMRG calculation.

        - the list of MP2 natural orbitals selected for the active space,
        - and the MO coefficient matrix containing all (active and inactive) MP2 natural orbitals.

    The columns representing the inactive orbitals in the MO coefficient matrix are ordered
    according to the convention of PySCF: occupied MOs to the left and virtual MOs to the right.
    By default, the original ordering of the MP2 natural orbitals is preserved. This can be
    changed by setting reorder_mos to True: then, the columns of the MO coefficients are reordered
    such that they can be passed directly to CASCI/CASSCF without any further sorting.

    This function does not provide active spaces for individual excited electronic states.
    However, it can be used to obtain active space suggestions for state-averaged calculations.
